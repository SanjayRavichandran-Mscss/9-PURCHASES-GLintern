This project involves developing a backend API using Node.js and MySQL for managing user registrations, product details, and purchase records. The application consists of three main tables: user_details, product_details, and purchase_details, all connected via relationships.

The core functionality includes:

A user-register endpoint for adding users.
A product-register endpoint for registering products.
A purchase-details endpoint to record purchases, ensuring the product's quantity is updated and validating user and product existence before inserting purchase data.
The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations, database connections, and the use of promises with mysql2/promise for asynchronous handling of MySQL queries. It also includes error handling and a single endpoint to manage all operations.
